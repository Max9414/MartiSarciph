Welcome everyone to my first project.

The project has been created to allow anyone interested in photoshooting for personal or company reasons to have an overview of this person work and get more details about the prices. There's also a registration section to ask for an appointment to get in touch with the photographer. This will allow users to be directly in contact with the artist.

Every page in the website presents this intro and this footer, with a variation of the colour.

Every footer and header has link to the 4 different pages and will have the currently selected page underlined with the only exception of the gallery page, which doesn't present a footer, as I thought it was breaking the flow of the page.

The main page presents an introduction to the photographer, with a description of early life, studies and focus of the photographer. Both the sections are well divided by colour and defined sections.

the section is then followed by a motivational speech to make the buyer more interested in the photographer and her qualities.

The gallery section won't have a screenshot, as it would be really hard to show in a single screenshot. It showcases shoots from the photographer as an example of her work.

The prices section is a simple layout with just a description of the different offers and the price range.

The subscription page is a simple layout, using multiple flex displays to achieve an easy and fast subscription.
