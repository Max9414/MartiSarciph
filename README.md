Welcome everyone to my first project.

The project has been created to allow anyone interested in photoshooting for personal or company reasons to have an overview of this person work and get more details about the prices. There's also a registration section to ask for an appointment to get in touch with the photographer. This will allow users to be directly in contact with the artist.

Every page in the website presents this intro and this footer, with a variation of the colour.

Every footer and header has link to the 4 different pages and will have the currently selected page underlined with the only exception of the gallery page, which doesn't present a footer, as I thought it was breaking the flow of the page.

The main page presents an introduction to the photographer, with a description of early life, studies and focus of the photographer. Both the sections are well divided by colour and defined sections. The second section has different layouts, depending on the screen size.

the section is then followed by a motivational speech to make the buyer more interested in the photographer and her qualities.

The gallery section won't have a screenshot, as it would be really hard to show in a single screenshot. It showcases shoots from the photographer as an example of her work.

The prices section is a simple layout with just a description of the different offers and the price range.

The subscription page is a simple layout, using multiple flex displays to achieve an easy and fast subscription.

TESTING

I've done plenty of testing, asking for help to friends too making the site public for a little while
Everything seem to be working fine, I had just to change the background for the mobile version somewhere.

Validator testing passed:
Both, css and html passed.
I tried to copy and paste the result but it was not showing anything

W3C CSS Validator results for TextArea (CSS level 3 + SVG)
Congratulations! No Error Found.

Most pictures are from my friend, also known as the phogtographer in this website.
The 2 lion pictures and the eyes are actually taken from google.

I used fonts from google fonts https://fonts.google.com/

Future implementations

Future implementations will concern only prices and subscription pages, or atleast this is the only I had
about it so far. I'd like the prices section to be shorter, having a small description where you could press
to show the detailed informations.

The subscription page, instead, would show the selected choices, you're a company or you're a private on the left
with a small description and you chose this offer with the full description on the right.
This, of course, would be possible only on bigger screens, so I'll think about some nice features to implement in
smaller screens.

I hope you enjoyed the project and I'm looking forward for any feedback.
