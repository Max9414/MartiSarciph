Welcome everyone to my first project.

The project has been created to allow anyone interested in photoshooting for personal or company reasons to have an overview of this person work and get more details about the prices. There's also a registration section to ask for an appointment to get in touch with the photographer. This will allow users to be directly in contact with the artist.

Every page in the website presents this intro and this footer, with a variation of the colour.

Every footer and header has link to the 4 different pages and will have the currently selected page underlined with the only exception of the gallery page, which doesn't present a footer, as I thought it was breaking the flow of the page.

The main page presents an introduction to the photographer, with a description of early life, studies and focus of the photographer. The section is short and well defined from the rest.
