                    <h3>Passion birth</h3>
                    <p>My need of sharing thouhgts and opinions has always been part of me. While I searched for a way to express myself, words were just not right to me,
                        but the beauty and clarity of a language without words is something that fascinates me. That's why and how my passions for photography and video were born.

                    <h3>My First Approach</h3>
                    <p>I started recording as a child, inheriting the passion from my dad, who owned a camera that I used to play with a lot.

                    <h3>My Achievements</h3>
                    <p>I'd like to focus mostly on culinarian aspects of photography, mixing these two beautiful arts in a single piece that caputres the beauty and the taste of a dish,
                        making the picture edible and tempting.

            <h3>Why Me?</h3>
            <p>There are many reasons why choosing me. I'm funny and smart, I'm easy but professional, I'm creative but pragmatic. I'm really good at helping others achieve what they want, even though I should do the same for myself a bit more.
                I'm an overachiever and I strive for perfection, without dieing for it. I love a good work that is not just technically nice but it means something to us, because we created together, and to other people because it has a message.
